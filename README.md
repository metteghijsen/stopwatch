# Stopwatch

## Project description
This is a project I made in my second year as a result of one of my teachers' CSS masterclass. There is no Javascript in this project. Therefore it is not very complicated.

## Installation
You can "install" this web page by downloading it and running it on a live server. You could use an external application such as XAMPP for this purpose. IDEs like Visual Studio Code have this feature built in.

When using XAMPP it is important to put the project in the htdocs folder. Then you can click on the Apache module. When you go to your browser and type in localhost/project name, it should open.

In case you have Visual Studio Code installed, you can open the project in there. Clicking on the 'Go Live' button in the status bar will open a live server where you should be able to see the project.

## Usage
If you go to my [school-website](https://i481695.hera.fhict.nl/stopwatch/), you can use the project without installing it.

The project consists of a stopwatch. When you hover over this stopwatch it starts ticking. The closer it gets to 0, the faster it starts moving. The stopwatch also slowly turns red.

This project is less extensive than I would have liked. Therefore I still plan to put a countdown timer in the stopwatch that you can set yourself. The time of the countdown animation is then also affected by the number of seconds you put there. So it works just like a real timer. Unfortunately I haven't had the time to do this yet.
